Working from home

We don’t impose caps on the amount of time that you can request to work from home. Each request is considered on its merits and approved wherever possible.

Generally our staff work from home 60% of the time, with the remaining 40% of time spent in the office.

This approach gives you flexibility plus the benefits of face-to-face collaboration and connection with colleagues and helps build a productive and balanced work environment.

However, everyone’s circumstances are different, and we’ll work with you to find an arrangement that fits you and the agency.
